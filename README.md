## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Trick question. It's not a thing. It's this guy:

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Install the generator.

To install generator-trendystore from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-trendystore
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
yo trendystore
```

## Create your project.

```bash
mkdir projectName && cd projectName
```

## Start developing!

Use [Grunt](https://gruntjs.com) to start a server.

```bash
grunt serve
```

When finished run:

```bash
